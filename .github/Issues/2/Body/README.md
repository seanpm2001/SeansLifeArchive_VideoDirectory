### New plan - Unified video archive (December 16th 2020)

I came up with a new plan to have a unified video directory yesterday (Wednesday, December 16th 2020)
The plan is to unify the main video directory to contain videos across various hard drives, so that I can better know what videos I have and don't have, so I know what not to download again.
I will try and find time to build this new structure. It will be an extension to the current video directory structure.

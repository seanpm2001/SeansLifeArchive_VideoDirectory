# Update: Day 1

This project is taking longer than I thought it would. I feel like I am going to need 1-2 more days to finish, possibly more. I got to the black 4 terabyte external hard drive today, but didn't fully sort it. There is still a lot to do on the blue 4 terabyte hard drive, that is when I can pull lots of new data for this project.
I am going to need more time tomorrow for this project, and also possibly more time on Monday and Tuesday. So far, I got over 150 GiB of data today over a connection speed of less than ~25 MiB/s

# Update: Day 3

I finished the video copying part of the project today. Despite the dongle change, there was only a 1 megabit increase in transfer speed. I am still trying to figure out how to sort and organize the videos, some duplicates and incomplete libraries were found. Tomorrow should be the last day of the project for now, unless something else occurs.

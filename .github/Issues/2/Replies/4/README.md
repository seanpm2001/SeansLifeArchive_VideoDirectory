# Update: Day 2

This project is taking longer than I thought it would. Today, I had to add an extra day to the time, as I got the data out of the root of hard drive 1AC, but not the internal backup of hard drive 1AA, plus I still have to sort all the data. I will do that tomorrow.
I still have sorting to do as well. I got a lot more videos than yesterday today, and had to wait over 4 hours for the file transfer process. I also found some things that I have been looking for for quite some time, including my `/seasonal channel logos/` directory. 
Today, I copied over 352 GiB of data from 1 hard drive to another at the slow speed of 20.4 MiB/s to 22.9 MiB/s. I recently found my dongle that I lost, and I am hoping for a speed improvement tomorrow. I unplugged the old adapter to make sure I don't accidentally use it again tomorrow.
I currently expect this project to take 2 more days, or by Tuesday, December 22nd 2020, but I still might need more time.
There still isn't enough data included to do an update on GitHub, I expect to do that on day 4 (Tuesday, December 22nd 2020) unless there are some delays.

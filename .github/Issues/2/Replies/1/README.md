**Update:** I have all my equipment ready, I plan on getting up nice and early tomorrow and booting up the server and working on it. I may work a lot less on GitHub today (I would have done actual programming today, as that was the original plan) as this server is going to take some time to navigate and structure. If it fails at step 6 (plugging in the 2nd server) I might have to quit the project for the day, and go back to the programming project. I will get to that eventually anyway. Sorry about the format of this message, I am really tired right now.

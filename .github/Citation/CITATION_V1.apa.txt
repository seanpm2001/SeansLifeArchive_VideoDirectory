Myrick family, S. P. M. (2021). Seans personal video database by Seanpm2001. It is a shell of my video collection, part of the Seanpm2001 life archive project that aims to archive every notable video I have ever watched. It is in a shell format where the folders and some files are there, but most files currently aren't due to size and copyright reasons. The database is put online here on GitHub for sharing, research, documentation, backup, machine learning, and stock purposes. [Data set]. https://doi.org/10.0000/00000

I don't have much footage of Linus Torvalds. I hope to obtain some more next, as he is a very interesting character. Today, I started with the line that I remember every time I see NVIDIA, which includes today when I found out that (Lenovo) Thinkpads are unfortunately off the table in my search for a new laptop.

Without further ado:

# Video downloads February 3rd 2021

**Notes:** I am trying to get into Vimeo again. Now when searching for non-music things, I am going to try Vimeo first before I have to go to the YouTube monopoly (I don't think Vimeo works for music right now, due to the fact that they don't have a monopoly on music like YouTube does) You can help make Vimeo more of a competitor, every new video helps. The pros of Vimeo is that it isn't as bad as YouTube, it has no ads, and is a lot more lax on things. The downsides is that the video player still has some DRM, and the library of videos is nowhere near that of YouTubes 13+ billion videos, and that it costs money to upload videos after you reach a weekly/total quota.

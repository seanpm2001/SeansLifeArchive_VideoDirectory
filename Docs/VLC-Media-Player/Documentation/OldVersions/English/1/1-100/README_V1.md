# Documentation

## VLC Media Player

As of 2020, VideoLan has poor documentation for VLC Media Player, and says that they are unable to pay for documentation writers. I haven't checked since, and I am in a bit of a hurry right now. - August 9th 2021

I have considered being someone who documents for VLC ever since, on August 9th 2021, I turned this `/Docs/VLC-Media-Player/` directory in my video set into a place to document VLC as much as I can with time I want to spend on it. It is a candidate for VLC documentation.
